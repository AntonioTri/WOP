This repository contains the source code and documentation for the game wich me and 2 colleagues of mine worked on

HOW TO START THE GAME:

1. Extract the "Progetto_Prog_3" folder from the ZIP archive.
2. Place the folder inside an IDE and make sure you have installed a JDK.
3. You can now find the "public static void main" inside the "MainClass.java" class.
4. Run the "main" and try to complete the game ;)

GAME CONTROLS:

- Use the "WASD" keys to move around the game map.
- Press the space bar to execute a jump.
- Press the left SHIFT key to perform a "DASH" in the direction of movement.
- Press the "E" key to execute an ultimate move.
- Left-click the mouse, press the trackpad, or press the "UP ARROW" key to perform a light attack.

!! CAUTION !!
Ultimate moves and dashes consume energy wich recharges over time. The dash requires 60 energy and the ultimate requires 200 energy (the maximum possible).

HAVE FUN!
